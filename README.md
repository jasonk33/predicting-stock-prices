# Predicting Stock Price Direction using Deep Neural Networks

Historical data from ~3000 stocks were downloaded through Google Finance

Momentum based performance metrics were calculated

These metrics were used to train a deep neural network using TensorFlow to predict the direction a stock would go over the course of a day, week, and month
